    <h1>About</h1>

    <h2>Why I made this page?</h2>

    <p>This webpage was assigned as a project milestone for my Intro to Web development class. This is a link to the <a href="https://ksuweb.github.io/IT3203/" target="_blank">class webpage</a>.</p>

    <p>After watching a plethora of youtube videos, course slides, and much googling, I have finally grasped the base level skills needed to create this webpage, however, there is much more I need to learn.</p>

    <p>When it comes to scripting the HTML for this website, the simple html format of title, head, body, and paragraphs were pretty easy to understand. It was implementing the CSS and JavaScript that threw me for a bit of a loop.</p>

    <h2>Style Inspiration</h2>

    <p>The CSS style and inspiration of this webpage comes from a mix of a stylesheet template that I saw used on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a> and a kind of techno/cyberpunk theme.</p>

    <p>As time goes on, I hope to upgrade this page with more advanced CSS and Javascript to fit that techno theme, including animations and more interactive features.</p>


    <h2>Helpful Tools/Links</h2>

    <p>As the heading suggests, in this section I will provide the tools and links to the platforms that helped me the most when creating this webpage. I hope these resources can help whoever stumbles across this page as much as it did for me.</p>
